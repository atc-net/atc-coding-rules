# Rule adding suggestion - Decision

### Rule summary

### What is the problem
This rule detects unused usings which can simply be removed. This rule is currently not a part of our coding rules and it should be.

### Decision

We update the `root/.editorconfig` with `severity = warning` and a doc-link.

### Reason & arguments

* This rule detects code that can be removed and no code is better than no code - see dissuction in [Issue #74](https://github.com/atc-net/atc-coding-rules/issues/74).
